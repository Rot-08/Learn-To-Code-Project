Learn To code Project Notes
1. The project has no back end properties, so the "registered" and "suspended" pages were added so as the give the sign up and login forms landing pages to their corresponding actions. Also, there was no script added to the page.
2. Due to the lack of both script and a back end, the pages cannot store user inputed information. As such, passwords and usernames will not be checked by the site upon signing and logging in. Also, the sign up page cannot confirm if indeed the user has entered the same password for both the "password" and the "confirm passord" boxes.
3. The naming convention used in the project (of pages, images, classes and id's) are as such to enable anyone reading the project understand the function or properties of each.
I believe evrything else in the project states its function and properties from its name.
